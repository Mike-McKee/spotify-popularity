"""Finding the songs in my playlist using Spotify's API

Five things are collected here:
-------------------------------
1. Track Name
2. Track ID (unique)
3. Track Popularity (based on Spotify's algorithm)
4. Names of all artists on each track
5. IDs (uninque) of all artists on each track

Spotify limits each requests to no more than 100 responses. So
I'm using an offset and a while loop to make multiple requests
until data for every song in the playlist is received.

At the end, the script creates a new file called playlist.json
that stores the five things listed above.
